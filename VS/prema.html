            <font face="Raleway" size="5">PREMĀ may be defined as the love of God, without any 
                expectation of exchange or return. Actually the words premā and love are not synonymous 
                because premā is considered to be higher than the feeling of love, yet one can say that 
                premā is the highest stage of love. It is stated in Vedic scriptures that one who has attained premā is the most perfect human being. As soon as one comes to the platform of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahamantra, without any offense, he becomes immediately enhanced in love with Kṛṣṇa; kṛṣṇa-prema. An example of this kind of love was exhibited by Lord Caitanya.
