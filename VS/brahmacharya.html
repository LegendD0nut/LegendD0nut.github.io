            <font face="Raleway" size="5">Brahmacharya is a concept within Indian religions that literally means to 
                stay in conduct within one's own Self. In Yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism it generally refers 
                to a life brahmacharya will attain to Brahman . For them there is freedom to act as they 
                wish in all the worlds. Now, what people call yajna , that is really brahmacharya.
