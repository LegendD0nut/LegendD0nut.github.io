            <font face="Raleway" size="5">In the Vedas and later sutras, the meaning of the word satya (सत्य) evolves into an ethical concept about truthfulness and is considered an important virtue.It means being true and consistent with reality in one's thought, speech, and action.

Satya is said to have cognates in a number of diverse Indo-European languages, including the word "sooth" and "sin" in English, "istina" ("истина") in Russian, "sand" - truthful in Danish "sann" in Swedish, and "haithya" in Avestan, the liturgical language of Zoroastrianism.
